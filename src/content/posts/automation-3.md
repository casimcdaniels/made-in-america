I used to operate a manual lathe - turning metal by hand, measuring with calipers. Now I program a computer-controlled machine. The pay jumped from $3,800 to $4,800 a year. The work is safer, cleaner. But I watch the older guys struggle. Some can't learn the new systems. They get transferred to maintenance, or they take early retirement. Progress is great, but what about the people left behind?
