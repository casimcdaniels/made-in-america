From oral history interview: These new automated control systems are incredible! My father worked the oil fields in the 1920s—backbreaking manual labor, dangerous work. Now I sit in a control room monitoring screens. The machines do the heavy lifting, the dangerous work. I make $4,200 a year—more than my father ever dreamed. But I had to learn new skills. The old-timers who couldn't adapt... they're gone.
