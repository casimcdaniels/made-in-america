I've been programming since the 1940s—back when 'computers' were people, mostly women, doing calculations by hand. As I've said: "The most dangerous phrase in the language is, 'We've always done it this way.'" Now we have machines that can do millions of calculations per second. But programming isn't about the machine—it's about solving problems, thinking logically, breaking down complex tasks. Women excel at this work. We've been doing it all along, just with different tools. The future of computing belongs to those who can think, not just those who can lift heavy equipment.
