I started as a 'computer'—doing calculations by hand. When NASA got the IBM 7090, I taught myself FORTRAN. As documented in Hidden Figures: "They were going to replace us with machines, but I showed them—we could program the machines." I became the first Black supervisor at NASA. Now I'm training other women to code. The machines don't replace us—they amplify our abilities. But you have to adapt, learn new skills, or you'll be left behind.
