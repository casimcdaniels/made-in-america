I started as a 'computer' - doing calculations by hand. When NASA got the IBM 7090, I taught myself FORTRAN. They were going to replace us with machines, but I showed them - we could program the machines. I became the first Black supervisor at NASA. Now I'm training other women to code. The machines don't replace us - they amplify our abilities. But you have to adapt, learn new skills, or you'll be left behind.
