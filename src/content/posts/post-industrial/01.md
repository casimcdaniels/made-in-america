The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports show automation is creating as many jobs as it's eliminating. I see it firsthand. We installed robotic welders—replaced 20 manual welders. But now we need technicians to maintain them, programmers to optimize them, supervisors to manage the new workflow. I had to go back to school, learn about these machines. The workers who adapt thrive. Those who don't... it's hard.
