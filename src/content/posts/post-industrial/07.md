I was a telephone operator for 10 years—connecting calls, routing messages. When AT&T started automating, I thought I'd lose my job. Instead, they trained us to program the switching systems. Now I write code for telephone networks. The skills transferred—attention to detail, logical thinking, problem-solving. Many of my colleagues couldn't make the transition, but those of us who did found better-paying, more interesting work. Technology doesn't have to eliminate jobs—it can transform them.
