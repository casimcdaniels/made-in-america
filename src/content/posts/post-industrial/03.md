Left the farm in '55, came to the city for factory work. Started on the assembly line - repetitive, mind-numbing. But then they automated my station. I thought I'd be fired. Instead, they trained me to maintain the machines. Now I'm a technician making twice what I did before. The machines didn't replace me - they gave me a better job. But I know I'm lucky. Not everyone gets that chance.
