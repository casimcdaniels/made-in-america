We came from Lithuania thinking America was the land of opportunity. Instead we found Packingtown - the stench, the filth, the exploitation. My husband Jurgis works the killing floor, I work trimming meat. We both come home exhausted, covered in blood. Our children play in the streets because we can't afford proper housing. But what can we do? We don't speak English well, we have no money to leave. This is our life now.
