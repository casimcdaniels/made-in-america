"They worked with furious intensity, literally upon the run—at a pace with which there is nothing to be compared except a football game. It was all highly specialized labor, each man having his task to do; generally this would consist of only two or three specific cuts, and he would pass down the line of fifteen or twenty carcasses, making these cuts upon each. First there came the 'butcher,' to bleed them; this meant one swift stroke, so swift that you could not see it—only the flash of the knife; and before you could realize it, the man had darted on to the next. And meantime, more cattle would be coming up behind; there was a chain of them, and the man could not stop. The foreman watched every move—work too slow, you're fired. Work too fast and make a mistake, you're fired. The stench was unbearable, the cold numbing. But we needed the wages—$1.50 a day to feed the family. There were always ten men waiting to take your place if you complained."
