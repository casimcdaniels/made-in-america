I've seen children working 12-hour shifts in the mills. I've seen men lose fingers, arms, their lives in the factories. The owners call us 'hands' - as if we're not human beings with families, dreams, dignity. We are not machines! We demand fair wages, safe conditions, and respect. The Haymarket affair showed us - when workers unite, we have power. Join the union!
