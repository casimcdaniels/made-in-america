I've seen children working 12-hour shifts in the mills. I've seen men lose fingers, arms, their lives in the factories. As I wrote: "I have never had a vote, and I have raised hell all over this country. You don't need a vote to raise hell! You need convictions and a voice!" The owners call us 'hands'—as if we're not human beings with families, dreams, dignity. We are not machines! We demand fair wages, safe conditions, and respect. The Haymarket affair showed us—when workers unite, we have power. Join the union!
