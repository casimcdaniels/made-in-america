The Pullman Strike showed the world that workers will not be crushed. When the company cut wages but kept rents high, we organized. When they fired union members, we struck. The government sent troops, but the spirit of labor solidarity cannot be broken. Every strike teaches us - we are stronger together. The age of industrial serfdom must end!
