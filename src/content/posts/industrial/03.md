From the 1906 U.S. House Report on Chicago Stockyards: "Workers report standing in blood and offal up to their ankles. The speed of the disassembly line has increased dramatically—men must work faster or lose their jobs." Accidents are common: severed fingers, crushed hands, falls into rendering vats. Children as young as 14 work alongside adults. The packing companies deny all claims of unsanitary conditions.
