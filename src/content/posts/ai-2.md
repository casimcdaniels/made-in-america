My job didn't exist 2 years ago. Now I'm making $200k teaching AI how to communicate effectively. As Norbert Wiener wrote in 'The Human Use of Human Beings' - the question isn't whether machines will replace us, but how we'll use them. The future of work isn't about replacing humans - it's about humans and AI working together. The best prompt engineers are creative, empathetic, and curious - skills AI doesn't have.
