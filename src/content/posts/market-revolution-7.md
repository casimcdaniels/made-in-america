From Twelve Years a Slave: I was a free man, a skilled carpenter, earning good wages in New York. Then I was kidnapped, sold into slavery. In Louisiana, I worked as a slave carpenter - skilled work, but I received nothing. My master hired me out, kept all my wages. Free white carpenters resented me - slave labor drove down their wages. But I was property, not a person. I had no rights, no freedom, no pay. The distinction between free and slave labor is not just about freedom - it's about who owns your body, your time, your labor.
