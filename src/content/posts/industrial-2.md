From The Jungle: The work is like a nightmare. We stand in blood up to our ankles, cutting meat hour after hour. The foreman watches every move - work too slow, you're fired. Work too fast and make a mistake, you're fired. The stench is unbearable, the cold numbing. But we need the wages - $1.50 a day to feed the family. There are always ten men waiting to take your place if you complain.
