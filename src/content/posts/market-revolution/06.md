From my Narrative: "I was now getting, as I have said, one dollar and fifty cents per day. I contracted for it; I earned it; it was paid to me; it was rightfully my own; yet, upon each returning Saturday night, I was compelled to deliver every cent of that money to Master Hugh." I worked as a caulker in Baltimore, a skilled trade. My master hired me out—he received my wages, I received nothing but the privilege of working. Free white caulkers resented slave labor—it drove down their wages. But my master preferred slaves—we couldn't quit, couldn't demand better pay, couldn't organize. The distinction between free and slave labor is not just about freedom—it's about who controls the fruits of labor. Free workers can organize, can strike, can demand better conditions. Slaves cannot. This is why slave labor is preferred—it's cheaper, more controllable, and the wages go to the owner, not the worker.
