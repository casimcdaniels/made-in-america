I'm free, but I'm not equal. White workers get $1.50 a day for dock work, I get $1.00. White workers get steady work, I get what's left over. The carpenters' union won't admit me - 'colored men need not apply.' The blacksmiths won't train me - 'we don't train colored apprentices.' So I'm stuck with the worst work, lowest pay. I'm free, but what does freedom mean when you can't get a fair wage, can't learn a trade, can't advance? I work harder than white workers, but I'm paid less, treated worse. This is what freedom means for colored men - the right to work for less.
