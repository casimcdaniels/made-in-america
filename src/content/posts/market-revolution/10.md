I'm free, but I'm not equal. As Douglass wrote: "The distinction between free and slave labor is not just about freedom—it's about who controls the fruits of labor." White workers get $1.50 a day for dock work, I get $1.00. White workers get steady work, I get what's left over. The carpenters' union won't admit me—'colored men need not apply.' The blacksmiths won't train me—'we don't train colored apprentices.' So I'm stuck with the worst work, lowest pay. I'm free, but what does freedom mean when you can't get a fair wage, can't learn a trade, can't advance? I work harder than white workers, but I'm paid less, treated worse. This is what freedom means for colored men—the right to work for less.
