I came to Lowell from a New Hampshire farm, thinking I'd work a few years, save money, then return home. But the work is harder than I imagined. We work 13 hours a day, the noise of the looms is deafening, and the air is thick with cotton dust. I cough constantly. The boarding house matron watches us like hawks - curfew at 10, church on Sunday, no men visitors. But I earn $3 a week - more than I could ever earn on the farm. I'm saving to help my family pay off debts. Some say this is 'respectable' work for women, but I wonder - is it respectable to work ourselves to death?
