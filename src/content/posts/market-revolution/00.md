I came to Lowell from a New Hampshire farm, thinking I'd work a few years, save money, then return home. As Harriet Hanson Robinson wrote: "The early mill-girls were of different ages. Some were not over ten years of age; a few were in middle life, but the majority were between the ages of sixteen and twenty-five. The working hours of all the mill-girls were from five o'clock in the morning until seven in the evening, with one-half hour for breakfast and for dinner." The noise of the looms is deafening, and the air is thick with cotton dust. I cough constantly. The boarding house matron watches us like hawks—curfew at 10, church on Sunday, no men visitors. But I earn $3 a week—more than I could ever earn on the farm. I'm saving to help my family pay off debts. Some say this is 'respectable' work for women, but I wonder—is it respectable to work ourselves to death?
