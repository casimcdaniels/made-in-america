I was a master shoemaker—had my own shop, my own tools, my own customers. Made good shoes, earned good wages, had respect. As de Tocqueville observed: "The master craftsmen become factory owners, journeymen become wage workers, apprentices become factory hands." Then factories started making shoes—cheaper, faster, not as good, but cheaper. My customers left, I couldn't compete. Lost my shop, lost my tools, lost everything. Now I work in a factory—same work, but I'm a wage worker, not a craftsman. I work for someone else, get paid by the hour, have no control. The factory owner makes the profit, I get a wage. I lost my independence, my skill, my dignity. This is progress?
