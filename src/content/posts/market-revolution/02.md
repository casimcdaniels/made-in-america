I've been working in the mill since I was 10. As Robinson wrote: "The early mill-girls were of different ages. Some were not over ten years of age." My family needed the money—father lost his farm, we moved to the city. I work 12 hours a day, same as the adults, but I get paid less. The machines are dangerous—I've seen children lose fingers, get caught in machinery. The foreman yells at us, hits us if we're slow. I'm always tired, always hungry. I can't go to school—we need the money. I'll work here until I'm too old or too broken, then what? This is my life—work, sleep, work again. I'm 12 years old, but I feel 50.
