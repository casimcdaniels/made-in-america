We moved west, thinking we'd have our own farm, our own land. As Crèvecœur wrote: "Here the rewards of his industry follow with equal steps the progress of his labour." But the work is endless. I rise before dawn, work until dark. Plant, weed, harvest, preserve, cook, clean, care for children, tend animals. My husband works the fields, but I work just as hard—the farm can't survive without my labor. But it's not recognized as 'work'—it's just what women do. We face crop failures, harsh winters, disease, isolation. Many families fail, lose everything, move on. We're free, but we're not free from work, from struggle, from hardship. This is the frontier—opportunity and exhaustion, hope and despair.
