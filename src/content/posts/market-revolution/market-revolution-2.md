From my Narrative: I worked as a caulker in Baltimore, a skilled trade. My master hired me out - he received my wages, I received nothing but the privilege of working. Free white caulkers resented slave labor - it drove down their wages. But my master preferred slaves - we couldn't quit, couldn't demand better pay, couldn't organize. The distinction between free and slave labor is not just about freedom - it's about who controls the fruits of labor. Free workers can organize, can strike, can demand better conditions. Slaves cannot. This is why slave labor is preferred - it's cheaper, more controllable, and the wages go to the owner, not the worker.
