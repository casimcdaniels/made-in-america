From Loom and Spindle: We organized! In 1834 and 1836, we went on strike - 'turnouts' we called them. We demanded shorter hours, better pay, an end to the speed-up. The company threatened us, fired the leaders, but we stood together. We were young women, far from home, but we had each other. The strikes failed - the company had too much power. But we learned that workers must organize. The factory system treats us as machines, but we are human beings with rights and dignity.
