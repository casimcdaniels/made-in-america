From Loom and Spindle: "In 1834 and 1836, we went on strike—'turnouts' we called them. We demanded shorter hours, better pay, an end to the speed-up." We organized! The company threatened us, fired the leaders, but we stood together. As Robinson wrote: "We were young women, far from home, but we had each other." The strikes failed—the company had too much power. But we learned that workers must organize. The factory system treats us as machines, but we are human beings with rights and dignity.
