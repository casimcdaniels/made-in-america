I thought AI would replace me. Instead, it amplified my work. As Autor's research shows: "When technology automates routine tasks, it often increases demand for non-routine work—creative problem-solving, human interaction, judgment." I used to write 5 articles a week. Now I write 20—AI helps with research, drafts, editing. I focus on strategy, creativity, human connection. My income doubled. But I had to learn new skills—prompt engineering, AI tooling, workflow optimization. The writers who adapted are thriving. Those who didn't... they're struggling. History repeats itself.
