I thought AI would replace me. Instead, it amplified my work. I used to write 5 articles a week. Now I write 20 - AI helps with research, drafts, editing. I focus on strategy, creativity, human connection. My income doubled. But I had to learn new skills - prompt engineering, AI tooling, workflow optimization. The writers who adapted are thriving. Those who didn't... they're struggling. History repeats itself.
