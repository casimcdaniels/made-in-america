Frey & Osborne's 2017 study found that 47% of US jobs are at high risk of computerization. But here's what gets lost in the headlines: it's not about job elimination, it's about job transformation.

We need massive retraining programs, not panic. History shows us that technological disruption creates as many opportunities as it destroys - but only if we prepare.
