My job didn't exist 2 years ago. Now I'm making $200k teaching AI how to communicate effectively. As Norbert Wiener wrote: "The answer, of course, is to have a society based on human values other than buying and selling. To arrive at this society, we need a good deal of planning and a good deal of struggle." The question isn't whether machines will replace us, but how we'll use them. The future of work isn't about replacing humans - it's about humans and AI working together. The best prompt engineers are creative, empathetic, and curious - skills AI doesn't have.
