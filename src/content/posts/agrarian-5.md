John writes from Philadelphia about independence, but here on the farm, independence means something different. It means we can feed ourselves, clothe ourselves, provide for our children without depending on anyone. The work is constant - planting, weeding, harvesting, preserving, spinning, sewing, cooking, cleaning. But this self-sufficiency is our freedom. No one tells us what to grow or how to live.
