The work of a farm wife never ends. This morning I churned butter, baked bread, mended John's work clothes, and managed the household accounts. As I wrote to John: "I am willing to allow the colony great merit for having produced a Washington, a Franklin, a Hancock, but I cannot help wishing that we had some of their spirit among us." Our servant girl helps, but I must teach her everything—how to preserve vegetables for winter, how to make soap from ashes, how to spin wool into yarn. These skills keep our family fed and clothed. The men work the fields, but without our labor in the home, the farm would fail. We are partners in this enterprise.
