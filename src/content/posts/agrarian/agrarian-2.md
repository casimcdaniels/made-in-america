The work of a farm wife never ends. This morning I churned butter, baked bread, mended John's work clothes, and managed the household accounts. Our servant girl helps, but I must teach her everything - how to preserve vegetables for winter, how to make soap from ashes, how to spin wool into yarn. These skills keep our family fed and clothed. The men work the fields, but without our labor in the home, the farm would fail. We are partners in this enterprise.
