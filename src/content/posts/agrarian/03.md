John writes from Philadelphia about independence, but here on the farm, independence means something different. As I wrote: "I long to hear that you have declared an independency. And, by the way, in the new code of laws which I suppose it will be necessary for you to make, I desire you would remember the ladies." It means we can feed ourselves, clothe ourselves, provide for our children without depending on anyone. The work is constant—planting, weeding, harvesting, preserving, spinning, sewing, cooking, cleaning. But this self-sufficiency is our freedom. No one tells us what to grow or how to live.
