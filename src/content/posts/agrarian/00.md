I rise with the sun and work until it sets. Today we plowed the north field—hard, honest labor that makes a man strong. The soil here in Massachusetts is rocky, but with patience and toil, it yields. As I wrote to my wife: "The business of America has been agriculture. This business has created, and will create, and maintain, the greatest proportion of the inhabitants." My hands are calloused, my back aches, but there is dignity in this work. We are not servants to any lord—we work for ourselves, our families, our community. This is what makes America different.
