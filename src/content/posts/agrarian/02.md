Came to work the harvest season. The master provides a bed in the barn and meals with the family. Hard work from dawn to dusk - cutting wheat with a scythe, threshing, storing grain. My hands are blistered, my muscles ache, but I'll earn enough to get through winter. Some men work year-round, but I move from farm to farm with the seasons. It's a hard life, but it's honest.
