The Civil War transforms American labor. In the North, the war accelerates industrialization as factories produce war materiel. Women enter factories in large numbers. In the South, the war disrupts the slave labor system. The war's end brings emancipation, fundamentally changing the labor system and setting the stage for new forms of exploitation and organizing.
