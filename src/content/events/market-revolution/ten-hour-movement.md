Workers organize to demand a ten-hour workday, challenging the standard 12-14 hour factory day. The movement spreads across New England, with workers petitioning state legislatures and organizing strikes. While largely unsuccessful, the movement establishes the principle that workers have the right to limit working hours and organize for better conditions.
