The completion of the transcontinental railroad marks the triumph of industrial capitalism. Built largely by Chinese and Irish immigrant labor under brutal conditions, the railroad transforms transportation and enables the growth of national markets. The project demonstrates the power of capital to organize massive labor forces and the expendability of immigrant workers.
