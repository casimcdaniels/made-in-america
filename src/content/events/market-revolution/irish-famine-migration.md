The Great Famine drives over a million Irish immigrants to America, many arriving destitute and desperate for work. They fill the lowest-paying jobs: domestic service, construction, factory work. Irish workers face discrimination and are used as cheap labor, driving down wages and creating tensions with native-born workers. Their presence transforms the American labor force.
