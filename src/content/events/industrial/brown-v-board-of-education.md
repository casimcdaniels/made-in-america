The Supreme Court rules that racial segregation in public schools is unconstitutional, overturning 'separate but equal' and beginning the end of legal segregation. While focused on education, this decision challenges the entire system of Jim Crow segregation, including workplace discrimination. However, workplace desegregation remains slow, with many employers maintaining segregated hiring practices.
