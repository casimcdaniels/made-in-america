African Americans in Montgomery, Alabama, boycott segregated buses for over a year, led by Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. The boycott succeeds when the Supreme Court rules bus segregation unconstitutional. This marks a turning point in the Civil Rights Movement, demonstrating the power of organized resistance to segregation and inspiring workplace organizing against discrimination.
