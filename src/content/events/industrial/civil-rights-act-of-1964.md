President Johnson signs the Civil Rights Act, outlawing discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in employment and public accommodations. This landmark legislation ends legal segregation and workplace discrimination, making it illegal for employers to refuse to hire Black workers or maintain segregated facilities. However, enforcement is slow, and many employers continue discriminatory practices.
