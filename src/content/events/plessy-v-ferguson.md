The Supreme Court rules that 'separate but equal' facilities are constitutional, legalizing racial segregation. This decision establishes Jim Crow laws across the South, creating a system of legal segregation that restricts Black workers to the lowest-paying, most dangerous jobs. Black workers are excluded from skilled trades, professional positions, and union membership, forced into segregated, substandard working conditions.
