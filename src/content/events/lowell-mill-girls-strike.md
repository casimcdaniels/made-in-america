Hundreds of Lowell mill workers stage the first major strike by women workers in American history. They protest wage cuts and increased work speed, organizing a 'turnout' that shuts down the mills. Though the strike fails, it demonstrates that women workers can organize and resist exploitation, setting precedents for future labor organizing.
