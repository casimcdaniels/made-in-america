The Fugitive Slave Act requires all citizens to assist in capturing escaped slaves, even in free states. The law intensifies the conflict between free and slave labor, as free workers see slave labor as a threat to their wages and rights. The act makes clear that the distinction between free and slave labor is fundamental to American society.
