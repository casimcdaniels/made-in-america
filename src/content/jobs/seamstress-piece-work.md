Seeking seamstresses for garment finishing. This is WOMEN'S WORK - sewing, finishing, piece work. You work from home or in a crowded workshop. Daily duties: Work 12-14 hour days, 6-7 days per week. Sew seams by hand - your fingers will bleed, your eyes will strain. Finish garments - hemming, buttonholes, trimming. Work piece-rate - the faster you work, the more you earn, but the rate is set so low you must work constantly to survive. Work in dim light - your eyesight will be destroyed by age 30. Your back will ache from hunching over. You'll work until you drop, then start again the next day. Many women work at home, trying to care for children while sewing. Others work in workshops - crowded, stuffy, no ventilation. The work is seasonal - busy before holidays, slow in summer. When there's no work, you starve. This is one of the few jobs available to women, but it pays starvation wages. You compete with other desperate women, driving down the piece rate. No benefits, no security, no future. Just work until you can't work anymore.
