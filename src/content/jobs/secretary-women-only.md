Secretarial position for professional office. Women only - this is 'women's work,' suitable for female temperament. Men are too valuable for clerical work. Daily duties: Arrive at 8 AM sharp - late and you're fired. Type letters, memos, reports all day - your fingers will ache. Take dictation from male bosses - write in shorthand, then type it up. Answer phones - be pleasant, never complain. Make coffee for all male employees - this is expected. File documents - endless filing, your back will hurt. Run errands - pick up dry cleaning, buy lunch, whatever boss needs. Work until 5 PM - but if boss needs you, stay until 7 or 8 PM. No overtime pay - it's expected. Bosses will make passes at you - smile and deflect, or lose your job. Must be attractive, well-groomed, wear dresses and heels. Must be single - if you marry, you're fired (husband should support you). If you get pregnant, you're fired. Must be 18-30 - after 30, you're 'too old.' This is dead-end work - no advancement, no raises, just typing until you're replaced by a younger woman.
