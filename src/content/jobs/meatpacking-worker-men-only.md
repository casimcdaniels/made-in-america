Fast-paced work in meat processing facility. Free labor only - slaves were freed, but conditions are worse than slavery. Stand in blood and offal up to your ankles. The stench will make you vomit - you'll never get used to it. Daily duties: Arrive at 5 AM. Kill hogs - slit throats, watch them bleed out screaming. Stand on killing floor slick with blood. Cut carcasses with razor-sharp knives - one slip and you lose a finger (happens weekly). Work in freezing cold (40 degrees) to prevent spoilage - your hands go numb. Lift 200-pound sides of beef onto hooks. Work at breakneck speed - foreman watches every move. Slow down? Fired. Make mistake? Fired. Complain? Fired. Ten men waiting to take your place. Lunch break: 15 minutes, eat standing up. Work until 7 PM. Go home stinking of blood and death. Your clothes will never be clean. Your hands will be permanently stained. Many workers lose fingers, hands, even lives. No women or children - too dangerous. Immigrants welcome - you don't speak English? Doesn't matter, just work faster. Piece-rate pay available if you work fast enough to earn it. No union members - we'll blacklist you.
