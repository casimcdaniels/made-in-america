Develop websites and web applications. Free labor - requires technical skills but pay varies widely. Daily duties: Arrive at 9 AM. Write code in JavaScript, HTML, CSS - frontend work, make it look good. Write backend code - Node.js, Python, PHP - make it work. Work with databases - MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL - store and retrieve data. Debug across browsers - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - each has different bugs. Test on mobile devices - responsive design, your eyes will strain. Work with designers - they create pretty mockups, you make them work. Deal with client requests - 'can you make this pop more?' 'can you add this feature?' Constant changes, tight deadlines. Must learn new frameworks constantly - React, Vue, Angular - everything changes. Work evenings and weekends - projects are always 'urgent.' Must be full-stack - frontend, backend, database, DevOps - but pay is for one role. $75-100k sounds okay but you're doing multiple jobs.
