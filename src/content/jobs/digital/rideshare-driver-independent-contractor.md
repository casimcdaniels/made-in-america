Drive passengers using rideshare app. Free labor - you're an 'independent contractor' so no minimum wage, no benefits, no rights. Daily duties: Wake up at 5 AM to beat traffic. Log into app - accept ride requests, drive passengers around city. Work 10-12 hour shifts - your back will ache, your legs will cramp. Deal with drunk passengers, rude customers, dangerous situations - you're alone in car. Pay for gas, car maintenance, insurance - expenses eat 30-40% of earnings. Platform takes 25% commission - you get 75% of fare. Must maintain high rating (4.8+) or you're deactivated - one bad passenger can ruin you. Work peak hours (rush hour, weekends, nights) to make money - but that's when traffic is worst. No benefits, no health insurance, no paid time off - you're a 'contractor.' If you get in accident, you're on your own. If you get sick, you don't work, you don't get paid. $15-25 per hour sounds okay but after expenses, it's $8-15 per hour. But you need the money, so you keep driving.
