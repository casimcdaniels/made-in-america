Manage online store operations and digital marketing. Free labor - this is 'marketing' work, so pay is moderate. Daily duties: Arrive at 8 AM (or log in from home). Manage product listings - write descriptions, upload photos, set prices. Optimize for search engines - SEO, keywords, meta tags, your eyes will strain. Run digital ads - Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Instagram Ads - spend company money, hope it converts. Analyze sales data - Google Analytics, conversion rates, customer behavior. Manage inventory - coordinate with warehouse, handle out-of-stock items. Write email campaigns - subject lines, content, A/B testing. Deal with customer service - angry customers, returns, complaints. Must understand web analytics, digital marketing, e-commerce platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce). Work evenings and weekends - online sales happen 24/7. Must be data-driven - everything is metrics, KPIs, ROI. $50-65k sounds okay but you're managing millions in sales, so pay is low relative to responsibility.
