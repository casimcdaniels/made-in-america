Create content for social media platforms. Free labor - you're 'self-employed' so no benefits, no security, no guaranteed income. Daily duties: Wake up at 6 AM. Film content - TikTok videos, Instagram posts, YouTube videos - perform constantly. Edit videos - hours in editing software, your eyes will strain. Write captions, hashtags, engage with followers - social media is 24/7. Post multiple times per day - algorithm demands constant content. Deal with hate comments, trolls, negative feedback - you're public, everyone judges. Must maintain 'authentic' brand - but it's all performance, all fake. Work with brands - sponsored posts, but you're competing with thousands. Income is unpredictable - one viral video, you make $1000. Next month, nothing. Most creators earn $0-500 per month - but you see the 1% making millions. Must invest in equipment - camera, lighting, editing software - you pay for it. No benefits, no retirement, no job security - if algorithm changes, you're done. Age 18-25 preferred - younger is better for social media. Must be attractive, charismatic, perform constantly - this is exhausting.
