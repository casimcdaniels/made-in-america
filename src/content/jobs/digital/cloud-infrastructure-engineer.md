Design and maintain cloud infrastructure on AWS. Free labor - requires elite technical skills and constant learning. Daily duties: Arrive at 9 AM (or work from home). Design cloud architectures - servers, databases, networking, security. Write infrastructure-as-code - Terraform, CloudFormation, your fingers will ache. Monitor systems 24/7 - if something breaks at 3 AM, you're paged. Deploy updates, manage scaling, optimize costs - one mistake costs company thousands. Learn new AWS services constantly - they release new features weekly, you must stay current. Deal with on-call rotations - sleep with phone nearby, ready to fix production issues. Work with DevOps tools - Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines. Must understand networking, security, databases, everything. High stress - production outages are your fault. Must pass rigorous technical interviews - system design, coding, AWS certifications. Relocation to Seattle required - expensive city, but pay is good. Work 50+ hour weeks - 'passion' means working weekends.
