Design user interfaces and user experiences for digital products. Free labor - requires design skills and creativity, but pay is lower than engineering. Daily duties: Arrive at 10 AM (designers work 'creative hours'). Open Figma - spend entire day designing screens, your wrists will ache. Research users - interviews, surveys, usability testing - understand what people want. Create wireframes, mockups, prototypes - iterate, iterate, iterate. Work with developers - they say 'this is impossible,' you simplify. Deal with feedback - 'make it pop more,' 'can you try a different color?' Constant revisions. Must understand psychology, accessibility, usability - but you're not a researcher. Must stay current on design trends - Material Design, iOS guidelines, everything changes. Work evenings and weekends - projects are always 'urgent.' Must have portfolio - years of work, but you're judged on it. Age 22-35 preferred - older designers are 'out of touch.' Must relocate to SF - expensive city, but that's where design jobs are.
