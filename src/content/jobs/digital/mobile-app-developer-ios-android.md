Develop mobile applications for iOS and Android. Free labor - requires technical skills but pay is lower than web development. Daily duties: Arrive at 9 AM. Write code in Swift (iOS) or Kotlin (Android) - learn both platforms, double the work. Design app interfaces - but you're not a designer, so UI suffers. Debug on multiple devices - iPhone 12, iPhone 13, Samsung Galaxy, Pixel - each has different bugs. Test on physical devices - buy your own phones, company won't provide. Deal with App Store/Play Store rejections - arbitrary rules, resubmit 5 times. Work with APIs, databases, authentication - full-stack work but mobile pay. Must learn new frameworks constantly - React Native, Flutter, SwiftUI - everything changes. Work 50+ hour weeks - startups expect 'passion.' Stock options that will probably be worthless. Must relocate to Austin - 'cool' city but expensive now. Age 22-35 preferred - older developers are 'out of touch' with mobile trends.
