Seeking domestic servant for wealthy household. Irish women preferred - they're cheap, desperate, and speak English (unlike Germans). This is WOMEN'S WORK - cleaning, cooking, childcare. Daily duties: Rise at 5 AM. Light fires, prepare breakfast. Clean entire house - scrubbing floors on hands and knees, your back will break. Wash clothes by hand - your hands will be raw and cracked. Cook meals - three meals a day for family and guests. Care for children - you're a nanny, teacher, and servant. Work until 9 PM, sometimes later. Sleep in attic or basement - cramped, cold, no privacy. You're on call 24 hours - family needs something? You do it. No days off - work 7 days per week. Your employer controls your life - where you go, who you see, what you wear. Irish women are preferred because they're Catholic (less threatening than Protestant servants), cheap, and desperate enough to accept terrible conditions. Many Irish women come alone, send money home to starving families in Ireland. You'll be treated as inferior - 'Bridget' is a slur for Irish servants. But it's work, and it's better than starving. Free labor - you can quit, but then you're homeless, jobless, with no references.
