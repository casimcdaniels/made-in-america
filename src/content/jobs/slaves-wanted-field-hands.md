Seeking NEGRO SLAVES for cotton cultivation. Slaves preferred over free labor - they work for life, can't quit, and their children are also property. We want strong, healthy slaves, preferably young. Daily duties: Rise before dawn (4 AM). Work cotton fields from sunup to sundown, 6 days per week. Pick cotton by hand - your fingers will bleed from sharp bolls. Work in blazing sun, no breaks. Overseer watches constantly - slow down and you're whipped. Work until dark, then tend your own garden plot (if allowed) to supplement meager rations. Food is cornmeal, salt pork, molasses - barely enough to survive. Sleep in crowded slave quarters - one room for entire family. Your children can be sold away at any time. You are property - not a person, but chattel. Can be bought, sold, whipped, or killed at master's will. No rights, no freedom, no hope. This is not a job - it is bondage. We prefer slaves over free labor because you cannot leave, cannot demand better conditions, and your labor is free for life.
