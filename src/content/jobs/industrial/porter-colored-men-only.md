WANTED: Colored Men for Porter Positions. The Pullman Company seeks colored men, between the ages of 18 and 45 years, to serve as porters on our passenger trains. White men need not apply, as this is colored men's work.

Duties include: Loading luggage onto trains; carrying passengers' bags; shining shoes; making beds; and performing such other services as may be required. Porters must be polite and respectful at all times, addressing white passengers as "sir" and "ma'am" and never using their first names. Porters must work 12 to 14 hour days and sleep in cramped quarters on the train.

Wages are $1.25 per day, plus tips. Tips constitute the main portion of a porter's income, as the base pay is minimal. Porters must compete with one another for tips, balancing friendliness with propriety. Porters who receive complaints from white passengers will be dismissed immediately.

This is the only work available to colored men on trains, as conductor, engineer, and other skilled positions are reserved for white men only. Colored men must accept segregation and the limitations placed upon them by Jim Crow laws.
