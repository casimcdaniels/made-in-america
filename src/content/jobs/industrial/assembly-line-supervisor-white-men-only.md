WANTED: Assembly Line Supervisor. General Motors requires an experienced supervisor to oversee automated assembly line operations. White men only need apply, as colored men are not considered for supervisory roles and women are not suited for management positions.

Duties include: Monitoring the automated assembly line for breakdowns and quality issues; managing a team of 20 to 30 workers; ensuring production quotas are met; dealing with union grievances; and reporting to the plant manager daily. Supervisors must work 10-hour shifts, sometimes extending to 12 hours when production is behind. They must walk the line constantly and deal with worker complaints.

Salary is $5,500 per year. Applicants must have 5 or more years of manufacturing experience, leadership skills, the ability to enforce discipline, an understanding of automated systems, and a high school diploma or equivalent. Military service is preferred, as it demonstrates leadership ability and the capacity to follow orders.

This is a union position, but supervisors must not be too friendly with the union, as the company monitors such relationships. Company rules must be enforced strictly, with no exceptions. Colored workers are assigned to the worst jobs and shifts, and women workers are kept in separate areas performing "women's work."
