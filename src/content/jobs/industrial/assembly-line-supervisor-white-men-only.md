Supervise automated assembly line operations. Free white male labor only - colored men are not considered for supervisory roles, and women are not suited for management. Daily duties: Arrive at 6 AM. Monitor automated assembly line - watch for breakdowns, quality issues. Manage team of 20-30 workers - mostly white men, some colored men in unskilled positions. Push workers to meet production quotas - if line slows, it's your fault. Deal with union grievances - but don't give in, company doesn't want to. Work 10-hour shifts, sometimes 12 if production is behind. Walk line constantly - your feet will ache. Deal with worker complaints - ignore most, fire troublemakers. Report to plant manager daily - if production drops, you're in trouble. Colored workers get worst jobs, worst shifts - that's just how it is. Women workers? They're in separate areas, doing 'women's work.' Must enforce company rules strictly - no exceptions. White men only - colored men can work the line but not supervise. Union position but don't be too friendly with union - company watches. Must have military service - shows you can lead and follow orders.
