WANTED: Colored Woman for Domestic Work. A private residence seeks a colored woman for household work. Colored women are preferred for domestic work, as white women will not perform this labor and colored women are considered naturally suited to servitude.

Duties include: Rising at 4 o'clock in the morning to light fires in all fireplaces; preparing breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the white family (eating scraps in the kitchen); washing all dishes by hand; scrubbing floors on hands and knees; laundering all clothing by hand, including boiling water, scrubbing on a washboard, and hanging heavy wet clothes; ironing everything; tending to white children, including feeding, bathing, and watching them; emptying chamber pots; and performing such other household tasks as may be required. The servant must work until 9 o'clock in the evening and sleep in a small room in the attic or basement.

Wages are $3 to $5 per week. The servant must live on the premises and is allowed one half-day off per week (Sunday afternoon), if she is lucky. She must be respectful and obedient at all times, as any "sass" will result in immediate dismissal. No days off are allowed for illness. References from previous white employers are required. No men or white women need apply, as this is colored women's work.
