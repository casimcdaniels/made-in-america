WANTED: Registered Nurses for Hospital Work. City Hospital seeks qualified women for nursing positions. Nursing is considered women's work, suited to the female nature, while men serve as doctors. White women are preferred for white patient wards, while colored women may apply for colored patient wards only, as segregation is required by hospital policy.

Duties include: Changing bedpans; bathing patients; changing dressings; emptying drainage bags; lifting and moving patients; following doctors' orders; and providing comfort to patients and their families. Nurses must work 12-hour shifts, sometimes extending to 16 hours when short-staffed, including nights, weekends, and holidays.

Salary is $3,800 per year. Applicants must have a nursing degree or certificate and must be between the ages of 21 and 35 years. Nurses must be unmarried or willing to resign immediately upon marriage, as it is expected that husbands will provide for their wives. Nurses who become pregnant will be dismissed immediately.

Colored nurses will be assigned to colored patient wards only, in accordance with hospital policy and segregation requirements.
