WANTED: Young Women for Textile Mill Work. The Lowell Mill Company seeks young women, between the ages of 15 and 30 years, for employment operating looms and spinning machines. Women are preferred for this work, as their small fingers are better suited to handling thread and operating machinery.

The work consists of operating power looms and spinning machines from 5 o'clock in the morning until 7 o'clock in the evening, 14 hours per day, six days per week. Women must stand for the entire shift, watching threads and fixing breaks immediately to avoid fines. The work is noisy and dusty, and women must work in conditions where cotton dust is constantly present.

Wages are $1.25 per day. All workers must live in the Company boarding house, where strict rules are enforced: curfew at 10 o'clock in the evening, church attendance required on Sundays, no male visitors permitted, and no leaving the boarding house after dark. Meals are provided in the boarding house, and workers must sign a contract agreeing to all Company rules.

Applicants must be young, single, without children, and of good moral character. Women who marry or become pregnant will be dismissed immediately. Those who complain or fail to follow Company rules will also be dismissed.
