Operate looms and spinning machines in textile mill. Free young women preferred - cheaper than men, more docile, and small fingers work better with machinery. Women only - no men. Daily duties: Rise at 4:30 AM. Eat breakfast in boarding house (monitored by matron). Walk to mill in dark. Work from 5 AM to 7 PM - 14 hours. Stand all day operating looms. The noise is deafening - you cannot hear yourself think. Cotton dust fills your lungs - you'll cough constantly, many develop 'brown lung' disease. Watch threads constantly - one breaks, you must fix it immediately or be fined. Your fingers will bleed from handling rough thread. Overseer watches constantly - slow down and you're docked pay. Lunch break: 30 minutes, eat at your machine. Work until 7 PM. Walk home exhausted. Dinner in boarding house at 8 PM. Lights out at 10 PM - no reading, no talking. Church required Sunday morning, then rest. No men visitors ever. No leaving boarding house after dark. Must be young (15-30), single, without children, of good moral character. If you marry, you're fired. If you get pregnant, you're fired. If you complain, you're fired. Sign contract agreeing to all rules or don't apply.
