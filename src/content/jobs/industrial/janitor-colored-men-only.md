WANTED: Colored Men for Janitorial Work. An office building seeks colored men, between the ages of 18 and 50 years, for janitorial positions. White men need not apply, as this is colored men's work.

Duties include: Sweeping and mopping floors; emptying wastebaskets; cleaning windows; polishing floors; and performing such other cleaning tasks as may be required. Janitors must work early morning and evening hours, arriving at 5 o'clock in the morning before white workers arrive and working until 7 o'clock in the evening after white workers leave.

Wages range from $8 to $10 per week. Janitors must work in segregated conditions, using colored-only bathrooms and water fountains. They must remain invisible to white workers, working in basements and back rooms and avoiding interaction with white employees. Janitors must never use the front entrance or ride elevators with white people.

Jim Crow laws require strict segregation, and colored men must accept these limitations. Janitors who receive complaints from white workers will be dismissed immediately.
