Colored men only - this is colored men's work. White men won't do this work, and colored men are considered suited for manual labor. Jim Crow laws require segregation - you work in colored-only areas, use colored-only facilities. Daily duties: Arrive at 5 AM, before white workers arrive. Clean all offices - sweep, mop, empty trash. Clean bathrooms - white bathrooms and colored bathrooms are separate. You can only use colored bathrooms, colored water fountains. Scrub floors on hands and knees - your knees will be raw. Empty wastebaskets, clean windows, polish floors. Work until 7 PM, after white workers leave. You must be invisible - white workers shouldn't see you, shouldn't interact with you. If a white worker complains about you, you're fired. You work in the basement, the back rooms, the colored-only areas. Never use the front entrance - that's for white people. Never ride the elevator with white people - wait for the next one. You're not a person, you're a cleaning machine. $8-10 per week - barely enough to survive, but it's work. Colored men only - white men don't do this work.
