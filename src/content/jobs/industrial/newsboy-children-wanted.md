Sell newspapers on street corners. Child labor preferred - children work for less, are more persistent, and don't complain. Boys and girls accepted, age 8-14. Daily duties: Wake at 4 AM. Go to newspaper office. Must BUY papers upfront - 50 cents for 100 papers. If you don't have money, you can't work. Carry heavy stack of papers (30+ pounds) to your corner. Stand on street corner from 5 AM to 8 AM shouting 'Extra! Extra! Read all about it!' Then go to school (if you go). After school, back to corner from 3 PM to 7 PM. Work in rain, snow, freezing cold, blazing heat. If papers don't sell, you lose your money. Many days you make nothing - or lose money. Older newsboys will beat you up and steal your spot if you're weak. Police will chase you if you're on wrong corner. Work until dark, then home to sleep. Repeat every day, 365 days a year. No days off - if you don't work, you don't eat. Many children sleep on streets, have no home. Must work regardless of weather, illness, or exhaustion. No guaranteed wage - you might earn 10 cents a day, or lose 50 cents. This is not a job - it's survival.
