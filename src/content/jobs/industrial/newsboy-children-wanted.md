WANTED: Newsboys and Newsgirls. The New York Herald seeks children, between the ages of 8 and 14 years, to sell newspapers on street corners. Both boys and girls are accepted.

Children must purchase papers upfront at the rate of 50 cents for 100 papers. They must carry a heavy stack of papers (30 pounds or more) to their assigned corner and sell them throughout the day. Children work from 5 o'clock in the morning until 8 o'clock in the morning, then return after school from 3 o'clock in the afternoon until 7 o'clock in the evening. They must work in all weather conditions, including rain, snow, freezing cold, and extreme heat.

Payment is by commission only, with no guaranteed wage. Children may earn 10 cents per day or more, depending on how many papers they sell. However, if papers do not sell, children lose their initial investment. Children must work 365 days per year, as there are no days off. If children do not work, they do not earn money.

Children must be able to carry heavy loads and work regardless of weather, illness, or exhaustion. Older newsboys may be aggressive in defending their corners, and children must be prepared to compete for the best locations.
