WANTED: Machine Operators for Steel Production. The Carnegie Steel Works requires experienced men to operate industrial machinery in our steel production facility. White men are preferred, as they may be considered for advancement to foreman positions.

The work consists of operating rolling mills and other machinery used in steel production. Operators must work 12-hour shifts in extreme heat (temperatures exceeding 120 degrees near furnaces). The work requires considerable physical strength, as operators must lift steel bars weighing 100 pounds or more using tongs. The work is extremely dangerous, and accidents, including burns from molten steel, are not uncommon.

Wages are $2.00 per day. Men must provide their own safety equipment if desired, though the Company does not require it. The Company assumes no responsibility for accidents or injuries. Men who are injured or become ill must provide for their own care. The work is noisy and dusty, and men must work in conditions where metal dust and smoke are constantly present.

White men are preferred for skilled positions, though immigrants may be considered for unskilled or dangerous work. Colored men need not apply, as they are only suitable for unskilled labor. Union members will not be considered for employment.
