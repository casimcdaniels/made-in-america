Operate industrial machinery in steel production facility. Free white labor preferred - colored men are considered unreliable, and we want workers who can be promoted to foreman. Extremely dangerous work. Daily duties: Arrive at 6 AM. Work 12-hour shifts in inferno heat (120+ degrees near furnaces). Operate rolling mills - one mistake and molten steel splashes on you. Burns are constant - your skin will be covered in scars. Lift 100-pound steel bars with tongs. The noise is deafening - you'll go partially deaf within months. Breathe in metal dust and smoke - your lungs will be black. No safety equipment - goggles, gloves, masks cost money. If you lose a finger, hand, or arm? That's your problem. If you die? Your family gets nothing. Work until 6 PM. Go home exhausted, covered in soot and burns. Many men die - crushed by machinery, burned by molten steel, suffocated by fumes. White men preferred for skilled positions, but we'll take immigrants for dangerous work. Colored men need not apply - they're only good for unskilled labor. Union members will be blacklisted and fired immediately.
