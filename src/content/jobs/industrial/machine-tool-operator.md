WANTED: Machine Tool Operators for Aircraft Manufacturing. Boeing Aircraft requires skilled operators to run computer-controlled machine tools for aircraft parts manufacturing. This is defense work and requires loyalty and security clearance.

Duties include: Programming computer-controlled lathes and mills; loading raw materials; monitoring cutting operations; measuring finished parts with precision instruments (tolerance 0.001 inches); and maintaining quality standards. Operators must work in a clean facility, though cutting fluid mist is present. The work requires standing for 8 hours and working with dangerous machinery.

Salary is $4,800 per year. Applicants must have mechanical skills, the ability to read blueprints and technical drawings, and a high school diploma or equivalent. Men are preferred for technical work, though women may be considered for simpler operations.

All applicants must pass a security clearance, including an FBI background check, and must sign a loyalty oath affirming that they are not communists or subversives and will not question authority. Reliability is essential, as defense contracts depend on the quality of work performed.
