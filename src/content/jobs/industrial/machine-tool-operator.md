Operate computer-controlled machine tools for aircraft parts manufacturing. Free labor only - this is defense work, requires loyalty and security clearance. Daily duties: Arrive at 7 AM. Program computer-controlled lathes and mills - one mistake and expensive part is ruined. Load raw materials into machines. Monitor cutting operations - watch for tool wear, adjust speeds. Measure finished parts with precision instruments - tolerance is 0.001 inches. Work in clean facility but breathe cutting fluid mist all day - your lungs will suffer. Stand for 8 hours - your back and feet will ache. Work with dangerous machinery - lose focus and you lose a finger. Quality is everything - one bad part could cause plane crash. Must pass security clearance - FBI will investigate you, your family, your friends. Must sign loyalty oath - no communists, no subversives, no questioning authority. Men preferred for technical work, but will consider women for simpler operations (but pay them less). Must be reliable - defense contracts depend on it.
