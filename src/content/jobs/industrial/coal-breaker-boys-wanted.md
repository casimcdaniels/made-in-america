WANTED: Boys for Coal Breaker Work. The Anthracite Coal Company seeks boys, between the ages of 8 and 14 years, to work in the coal breakers separating slate from coal. Boys are preferred for this work, as their small hands are better suited to picking through coal.

The work consists of sitting on a wooden bench for 10 hours per day, picking through moving coal on a conveyor belt and separating slate from coal by hand. Boys must work in a dark, windowless building filled with coal dust. The work is noisy, and boys must work in conditions where coal dust is constantly present. The work is dangerous, and accidents, including loss of fingers or hands when caught in machinery, are not uncommon.

Wages range from 50 cents to $1.00 per day, depending on age and ability. Boys must bring their own lunch and are allowed 15 minutes to eat. Hours are from 6 o'clock in the morning until 6 o'clock in the evening, six days per week. Parental consent is required for minors.

Boys as young as 8 years of age are accepted. The work is arduous and requires boys to sit hunched over for the entire shift. No girls need apply, as this work is suitable only for boys.
