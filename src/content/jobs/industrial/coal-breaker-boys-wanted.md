Boys needed to separate slate from coal. Child labor preferred - small hands work better, and we pay them less than men. Work in coal breakers - dark, dusty, dangerous. Daily duties: Arrive at 6 AM (your parents wake you). Work in breaker building - dark, windowless, filled with coal dust. Sit on wooden bench for 10 hours. Pick through moving coal on conveyor belt. Separate slate from coal with your bare hands - coal is sharp, your fingers will bleed. Breathe coal dust all day - your lungs will be black by age 12. Many boys develop 'black lung' disease. The noise is constant - machinery never stops. If you slow down, foreman beats you. Lunch: 15 minutes, eat the food you brought (usually just bread). Work until 6 PM. Walk home covered in black dust, exhausted. Your back aches from sitting hunched over all day. Your eyes strain in the dim light - many boys go blind. Accidents are common - boys lose fingers, hands, even lives when caught in machinery. Boys as young as 8 accepted - the younger, the better (smaller hands, cheaper pay). No girls - this is boys' work. Your family needs the money - 50 cents a day helps put food on the table.
