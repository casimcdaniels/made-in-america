WANTED: Men for Meatpacking Work. The Chicago Stockyards requires able-bodied men for work in our meat processing facility. The work is fast-paced and requires considerable physical strength and stamina.

The work consists of killing hogs, cutting carcasses, and processing meat. Men must work in freezing conditions (approximately 40 degrees) to prevent spoilage, standing in blood and offal. The work requires the use of sharp knives and other cutting tools, and accidents, including loss of fingers or hands, are not uncommon. Men must work at high speed, as production quotas must be met.

Wages are $1.50 per day for 10 to 12 hour shifts, six days per week. Piece-rate pay is available for those who work fast enough to earn it. Men are allowed 15 minutes for lunch, which must be eaten standing up. The work is extremely dangerous, and the Company assumes no responsibility for accidents or injuries.

No prior experience is necessary, as training will be provided. Immigrants are welcome, as English is not required. No women or children need apply, as the work is too dangerous. Union members will not be considered for employment.
