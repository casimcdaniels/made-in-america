Develop software applications using FORTRAN and COBOL. Free labor - this is skilled technical work requiring education. Men preferred for programming - women's minds aren't suited for logic and technical thinking. Women can do data entry, but not real programming. Daily duties: Arrive at 8 AM. Write code on punch cards - one mistake means retyping entire card deck. Debug programs by reading through thousands of lines of code - your eyes will strain. Test programs on mainframe - wait hours for results, then fix errors. Work with massive machines that fill entire rooms. Write documentation - tedious but required. Attend meetings with male managers - if you're a woman, they'll ignore your input. Work 50+ hour weeks - programming requires long hours. Deal with system crashes - lose hours of work, start over. Men get interesting projects, women get data entry - that's just how it is. Training provided but men advance faster - they're 'naturally better' at this work. Must be willing to work unpaid overtime - 'passion for computing' means working for free.
