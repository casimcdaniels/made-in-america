WANTED: Miners for Coal Extraction. The subscriber requires able-bodied men for work in the coal mines. Irish and Welsh immigrants are particularly welcome, as they have proven themselves industrious and reliable workers.

The work consists of descending into the mine before dawn, extracting coal with pickaxe and shovel, and loading it into carts for transport to the surface. Men must work in darkness, in cramped conditions, and must be prepared to labor 10 to 12 hours per day, six days per week. The work is arduous and requires considerable physical strength.

Wages range from $1.50 to $2.00 per day, depending on the amount of coal extracted. Miners must provide their own tools and candles. The work is dangerous, as cave-ins and explosions are not uncommon, and men must work in conditions where coal dust is constantly present. Those who are injured or become ill must provide for their own care, as the Company assumes no responsibility for accidents or disease contracted in the mines.

Irish and Welsh workers are preferred as they are willing to work for lower wages than native-born Americans and are less likely to cause trouble or organize against their employers.
