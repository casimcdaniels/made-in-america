Seeking miners for coal extraction. This is BRUTAL, DANGEROUS work - men die daily. Irish and Welsh immigrants preferred - they work cheap, work hard, can't complain. Daily duties: Descend into mine before dawn - dark, cramped, suffocating. Dig coal with pickaxe - your arms will shake with exhaustion. Load coal into carts - your back will break. Work in darkness, breathing coal dust - your lungs will be destroyed. Cave-ins are constant - you'll be buried alive. Explosions from gas - you'll be burned, crushed, killed. Work 10-12 hour days, 6 days per week. Many miners die before age 40 - black lung, accidents, explosions. If you're injured, you're fired. If you die, they hire another. No safety regulations - accidents are your fault. Irish workers are preferred - they're desperate, work for less, less likely to organize. This is free labor, but it's worse than slavery in many ways - at least slaves are valuable property, you're disposable. But it's work, and for immigrants with no other options, it's better than starving.
