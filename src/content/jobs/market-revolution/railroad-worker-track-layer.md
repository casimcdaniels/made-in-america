WANTED: Strong Men for Railroad Construction. The Central Pacific Railroad Company requires able-bodied men for work laying track across the western territories. Irish and Chinese immigrants are particularly welcome, as they have proven themselves capable of performing this arduous labor.

The work consists of carrying iron rails weighing 100 pounds or more, laying track, driving spikes with sledgehammers, and performing such other tasks as may be required in the construction of the railroad. Men must be prepared to work 12 to 14 hours per day, six or seven days per week, in all weather conditions.

Wages range from $1.00 to $1.50 per day, depending on the nature of the work. Men will be housed in tent camps near the work site. Provisions will be provided, though men may supplement their diet at their own expense. The work is dangerous, and accidents are not uncommon. Men who are injured or become ill must provide for their own care, as the Company assumes no responsibility for accidents or disease.

Irish workers are preferred for track laying, as they are strong and willing to work for wages lower than those demanded by native-born Americans. Chinese workers are employed for blasting and tunneling work, as they have proven themselves capable of performing the most dangerous tasks.
