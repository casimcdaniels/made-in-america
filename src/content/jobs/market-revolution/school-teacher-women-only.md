WANTED: A School Teacher for a Common School. The school district seeks a qualified woman to instruct children in a one-room schoolhouse. This is a respectable position suitable for young ladies of good character and education.

The teacher will be responsible for instructing all grades in one room, typically 30 to 50 students ranging in age from 5 to 16 years. Subjects include reading, writing, arithmetic, and basic geography. The teacher must maintain discipline, keep the schoolhouse clean, and perform such other duties as may be required.

The position pays $4 to $8 per month, with room and board provided by rotation among local families. The teacher will board with a different family each month. Hours are from 8 o'clock in the morning until 4 o'clock in the afternoon, six days per week, with additional time required for preparation and grading.

Applicants must be free white women, between the ages of 18 and 30 years, preferably single, with basic education and good moral character. References attesting to character and ability are required. This is one of the few professional opportunities available to women, offering respectability and independence, though the compensation is modest. Married women are discouraged from applying, as it is expected that husbands will provide for their wives.
