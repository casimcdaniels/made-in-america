Seeking schoolteacher for one-room schoolhouse. This is one of the FEW PROFESSIONAL ROLES for women - teaching is considered 'women's work' because it's nurturing, like motherhood. But pay is low, conditions are poor. Daily duties: Teach all grades in one room - ages 5-16, 30-50 students. Teach reading, writing, arithmetic, basic geography. Maintain discipline - many students are older, stronger than you. Clean the schoolhouse - you're janitor too. Board with local families - rotate monthly, never have a home. Work 6 days per week, sometimes 7. Your pay is docked for room and board - you'll save little. Many teachers are young, single women - they work a few years, then marry and quit (expected to). Married women are discouraged from teaching - husbands should support them. You must be 'respectable' - good moral character, proper behavior. The community watches you constantly. But it's better than factory work or domestic service - you have some respect, some independence. Free white women only - this is one of the few opportunities for education and professional work.
