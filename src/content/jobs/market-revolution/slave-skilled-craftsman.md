WANTED: A Skilled Negro Slave for Hire. The subscriber wishes to hire a skilled slave craftsman, preferably a carpenter, blacksmith, or similar tradesman, for work in a workshop. The slave must be between the ages of 20 and 35 years, strong, healthy, and trustworthy.

The slave will work as a skilled craftsman, performing such tasks as may be required in the trade. Hours are from sunrise to sunset, six days per week. All wages earned by the slave will be paid directly to the owner, not to the slave. The slave will receive room and board, and may be allowed to keep a small portion of any extra earnings, at the owner's discretion.

Skilled slaves are valuable property and are in high demand, as they can earn substantial wages for their owners. However, skilled slaves also pose a risk, as they have more freedom of movement and contact with free workers, which may provide opportunities for escape. Owners who hire out skilled slaves must trust that the slave will not attempt to run away.

The subscriber will pay fair market rates for the hire of a skilled slave. Free workers may object to competing with slave labor, but owners prefer to hire out slaves as they are more reliable and cannot quit or demand higher wages.
