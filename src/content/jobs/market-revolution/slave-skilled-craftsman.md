Seeking skilled NEGRO SLAVE for hire-out work. This slave will be hired to work in a workshop, but wages go to owner, not slave. Skilled slaves are valuable - they earn more for the owner. But they're also dangerous - skilled slaves have more freedom, more contact with free workers, more opportunity to run away. Daily duties: Work as skilled craftsman - carpentry, blacksmithing, or similar. Work 10-12 hour days, 6 days per week. Your owner receives your wages - you get nothing but room and board. You may be allowed to keep small portion if you work extra, but that's at owner's discretion. You have more freedom than field hands - can move around city, interact with free workers. But you're still property. Your owner can sell you at any time, separate you from family. If you run away, you'll be hunted, whipped, maybe killed. Skilled slaves are in high demand - owners can hire them out for good wages. But you're still a slave - not free, not paid, not human in the eyes of the law. Free workers don't like competing with slave labor - it drives down wages. But owners prefer slaves - they're cheaper, can't quit, and wages go to owner.
