Seeking experienced journeyman shoemaker. The trade is changing - factories are replacing workshops, but skilled craftsmen still needed for quality work. This is MEN'S WORK - requires strength and skill. Daily duties: Cut leather by hand - your hands will be calloused and stained. Stitch soles to uppers - precise work, your back will ache from bending. Fit shoes to customers - measure feet, make lasts. Work 10-12 hour days, 6 days per week. The master owns the shop, you're a journeyman - better than an apprentice, but still dependent. You get paid by the piece - work fast or starve. Competition from factory-made shoes is driving down prices - you must work harder for less. Many shoemakers are organizing - joining unions, striking for better wages. But the master doesn't like that. If you join a union, you'll be blacklisted. Free white men only - this is skilled work requiring education and freedom. Slaves cannot be apprenticed to skilled trades. You must have completed apprenticeship - 7 years of training. The old ways are dying - factories will replace us all, but for now, skilled craftsmen are still needed.
