WANTED: An Experienced Journeyman Shoemaker. A master craftsman seeks a skilled journeyman to work in his shop. The applicant must have completed a full seven-year apprenticeship and be capable of performing all aspects of the trade, including cutting leather, stitching soles to uppers, fitting customers, and making lasts.

The work requires considerable skill and physical strength. Hours are from 6 o'clock in the morning until 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening, six days per week. Payment is by the piece, with wages ranging from $8 to $12 per week for a skilled journeyman. The journeyman must provide his own tools.

The trade is changing as factory-made shoes become more common, but skilled craftsmen are still needed for quality work and custom fittings. The master prefers journeymen who are not members of trade unions, as union activity is disruptive to the workshop. Free white men only need apply, as this is skilled work requiring education and the freedom to practice independently. Slaves cannot be apprenticed to skilled trades and are therefore ineligible.
