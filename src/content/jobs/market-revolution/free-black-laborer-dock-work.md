WANTED: Laborers for Dock Work. The subscriber requires able-bodied men for loading and unloading ships at the port. Free colored men are welcome to apply, as this work requires considerable strength and is often avoided by white workers.

The work consists of carrying heavy cargo on one's back, loading and unloading ships, and performing such other tasks as may be required. Men must be prepared to work in all weather conditions, from 10 to 12 hours per day when work is available. However, work is irregular, as it depends on the arrival and departure of ships. Men may work one day and have no work the next.

Wages range from $1.00 to $1.50 per day, depending on the nature of the work. Free colored men are typically paid less than white workers for the same work. There is no security of employment, and men who are injured or complain may be dismissed without notice.

Free colored men are excluded from skilled trades such as carpentry and blacksmithing, as trade unions will not admit them and masters will not train them. Dock work is one of the few employment opportunities available to free colored men, though the work is hard, dangerous, and poorly compensated.
