WANTED: Young Women for Textile Mill Work. The Lowell Manufacturing Company seeks industrious young women, between the ages of 15 and 30 years, preferably 18 to 25, for employment in our textile mills. This is respectable work suitable for young ladies from good New England families.

The work consists of operating power looms and spinning machinery. Hours are from sunrise to sunset, six days per week. The Company provides clean, well-regulated boarding houses with strict moral supervision. All boarders must observe curfew at 10 o'clock in the evening, attend church services on the Sabbath, and conduct themselves with propriety. No male visitors are permitted, and the use of spirits is strictly forbidden.

Wages range from $3 to $5 per week, with deductions made for room and board. The Company prefers young, single women as they are more reliable and teachable than men, and the boarding house system ensures their moral and physical well-being. Many young women work for a few years, save their earnings, and return home with a dowry and improved prospects for marriage. This employment offers young women independence and the opportunity to contribute to their families' welfare while maintaining their respectability.
