Seeking YOUNG WOMEN for textile mill work. This is 'respectable' work for women - better than domestic service, but still women's work. We prefer young, single women from New England farms. They're more docile, more reliable than men. Daily duties: Work 12-14 hour shifts, 6 days per week. Operate power looms - the noise is deafening, you'll go half-deaf. Stand all day, your feet will swell. Watch threads constantly - one break and the whole machine stops. You'll be fined for mistakes. The air is filled with cotton dust - you'll cough constantly, your lungs will be damaged. Work in hot, humid conditions - windows stay closed to maintain humidity. Company boarding house has strict rules: curfew at 10 PM, church on Sunday mandatory, no men visitors, no alcohol. Your wages are docked for room and board - you'll save little. But it's better than farm work, and you have independence. Many women work a few years, save what they can, then return home to marry. We prefer women because they're cheaper, more compliant, and we can control their lives through the boarding house system. Men are too independent, too likely to organize.
