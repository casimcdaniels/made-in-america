WANTED: Chinese Workers for Railroad Construction. The Central Pacific Railroad Company seeks Chinese laborers for work constructing the railroad through the Sierra Nevada mountains. Chinese workers are particularly suited for the dangerous work of blasting and tunneling.

The work consists of blasting through mountains, tunneling through rock, and performing such other tasks as may be required in the construction of the railroad. Men must be prepared to work 12 to 14 hours per day, six or seven days per week, in extreme conditions. The work is extremely dangerous, and accidents, including cave-ins and explosions, are not uncommon.

Wages are $1.00 per day. Men will be housed in tent camps near the work site. Provisions will be provided, though the quality may vary. The Company assumes no responsibility for accidents or injuries. Men who are injured or become ill must provide for their own care.

Chinese workers are preferred for this work as they are willing to work for lower wages than white workers and have proven themselves capable of performing the most dangerous tasks. The Company does not provide interpreters, and workers are expected to follow instructions as given. Union membership is not permitted.
