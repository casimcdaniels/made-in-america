Seeking Chinese workers for railroad construction through mountains. Chinese workers preferred for dangerous work - blasting, tunneling, working in extreme conditions. We pay you less than white workers, work you harder, treat you worse. Daily duties: Blast through mountains - many workers die in explosions. Tunnel through rock - cave-ins are common, you'll be buried alive. Work 12-14 hour days, 6-7 days per week. Live in tent camps - crowded, filthy, disease-ridden. Food is poor quality - you'll be malnourished. White workers get $1.50 per day, you get $1.00. White workers get better food, better housing. You get the worst of everything. Accidents are constant - crushed by rocks, explosions, falls. If you're injured, you're fired. If you die, we hire another. Chinese workers are considered expendable - cheaper than white workers, more desperate, easier to control. You can't speak English? Doesn't matter, just work. You can't organize? Good - we don't want unions. You're isolated, discriminated against, exploited. But it's work, and for immigrants with no other options, it's better than starving.
