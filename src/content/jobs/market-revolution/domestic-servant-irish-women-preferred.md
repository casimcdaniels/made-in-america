WANTED: A Domestic Servant for a Respectable Household. A family of means seeks a reliable female servant. Irish women are particularly welcome, as they have proven themselves industrious and willing to work for modest wages.

Duties include: Rising early to light fires and prepare breakfast; cleaning the entire house, including scrubbing floors and washing windows; laundering all linens and clothing by hand; cooking three meals daily for the family and any guests; caring for children; and performing such other household tasks as may be required. The servant must be prepared to work from early morning until late evening, seven days per week, and must be available at all times to attend to the family's needs.

The servant will receive room and board, and wages of $2 to $4 per month. Lodging will be provided in the attic or basement. The servant must live on the premises and conduct herself with propriety at all times. The employer reserves the right to regulate the servant's conduct, including where she may go and whom she may see.

Irish women are preferred as they are willing to work for lower wages than native-born Americans and are generally more compliant. References are required, and the servant must be of good moral character. Single women without children are preferred.
