Monitor and maintain automated refining equipment. Free white male labor preferred - this is skilled technical work requiring education and responsibility. Colored men are not considered for technical positions. Daily duties: Work rotating shifts - days, nights, weekends. Monitor control panels - watch gauges, dials, readouts for 8 hours. One mistake and entire refinery could explode. Walk through facility checking equipment - hot, loud, dangerous. Breathe chemical fumes - your lungs will suffer. Maintain automated systems - fix when they break. Work in extreme heat near furnaces. Respond to alarms at any time - if something goes wrong, you're responsible. Night shifts disrupt your sleep - you'll be exhausted constantly. Training provided but you must learn quickly - if you can't handle it, you're fired. Men only - this is not suitable work for women (too technical, too dangerous). White men preferred for supervisory positions. Must be 21 or older - need maturity for this responsibility.
