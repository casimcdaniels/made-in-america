Seeking strong men for railroad construction. This is BRUTAL work - building the railroads that will transform America. Irish and Chinese immigrants preferred - they work cheap, work hard, and can't complain. Daily duties: Rise before dawn. Carry 100-pound rails on your shoulders - your back will be destroyed. Lay track in all weather - rain, snow, blazing sun. Swing sledgehammers to drive spikes - your arms will shake with exhaustion. Work 12-14 hour days, 6-7 days per week. Live in tent camps - filthy, crowded, disease-ridden. Food is poor quality - you'll be malnourished. Accidents are constant - crushed by rails, run over by trains, explosions from blasting. Many workers die. No safety regulations - if you're injured, you're fired. If you die, they hire another. Irish workers are preferred for track laying - they're strong, desperate, and work for less than native-born workers. Chinese workers are preferred for blasting and tunneling - they're considered expendable. This is free labor, but it's worse than slavery in many ways - at least slaves are valuable property, you're disposable. But it's work, and for immigrants with no other options, it's better than starving.
