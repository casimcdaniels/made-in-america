Build and deploy machine learning models at scale. Free labor only - this requires elite education that excludes most people. Must have degree from top-tier university (Stanford, MIT, Carnegie Mellon preferred) - if you went to state school, don't bother. Daily duties: Arrive at 9 AM (or work from home). Write Python code for hours - your eyes will strain staring at screens. Train models on massive datasets - wait hours for training to complete, then realize your model is garbage, start over. Debug neural networks - spend days trying to figure out why accuracy dropped 2%. Attend meetings about 'AI ethics' - then ignore ethics to ship faster. Work with massive compute clusters - one mistake costs company thousands in compute costs. Deal with imposter syndrome constantly - everyone seems smarter than you. Work 50+ hour weeks - 'passion' means working weekends. On-call for production models - get paged at 2 AM when model breaks. Must pass 6-hour technical interviews - solve algorithms on whiteboard, explain ML theory, code live. If you don't have PhD from top school, you're competing with 1000 applicants for one position. Must relocate to Bay Area - $250k sounds like a lot but rent is $4000/month for 1-bedroom.
