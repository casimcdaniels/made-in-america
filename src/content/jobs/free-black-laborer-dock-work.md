Seeking laborers for dock work. Free colored men welcome - this is hard, dangerous work that white men avoid. But you'll be paid less, treated worse. Daily duties: Load and unload ships - carry heavy cargo on your back, your spine will be destroyed. Work in all weather - rain, snow, blazing sun. Work 10-12 hour days when work is available. But work is irregular - ships come and go, you may work one day, starve the next. You compete with other free colored men, Irish immigrants - all desperate for work. White workers get better jobs, better pay. You get the worst work, lowest pay. No security, no benefits, no future. If you're injured, you're fired. If you complain, you're fired. Free colored men are excluded from skilled trades - carpenters' unions won't admit you, blacksmiths won't train you. This is one of the few jobs available. You're free, but you're not equal. White workers resent you - they say you drive down wages. But you have no choice - this is work, or starve.
