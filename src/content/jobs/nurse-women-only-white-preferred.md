Nursing position in hospital. Free female labor - this is 'women's work,' suited to female nature (caring, nurturing). Men are doctors, women are nurses - that's the natural order. White women preferred for white patients - colored women may work colored wards only (segregation is required). Daily duties: Work 12-hour shifts, sometimes 16 if short-staffed. Change bedpans - the smell will make you gag. Bathe patients, change dressings, empty drainage bags. Lift patients - your back will be destroyed by age 40. Deal with doctors' orders - never question, just obey. Work nights, weekends, holidays - no exceptions. Watch patients die - you'll see death daily. Deal with families - comfort them, but don't get emotional. White patients get better care, better rooms - colored patients are in basement, get less attention. Must be unmarried - if you marry, you're expected to resign (husband should support you). If you get pregnant, you're fired immediately. Age 21-35 only - after 35, you're 'too old' for this work. Colored nurses work colored wards only - that's hospital policy, not our choice.
