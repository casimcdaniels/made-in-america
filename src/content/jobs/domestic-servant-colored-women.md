Colored woman needed for household work. Colored women preferred for domestic work - white women won't do this work, and colored women are considered 'naturally suited' to servitude. Daily duties: Rise at 4 AM. Light fires in all fireplaces. Prepare breakfast for white family - you eat scraps in kitchen. Wash all dishes by hand. Scrub floors on hands and knees - your knees will be raw. Launder all clothing by hand - boiling water, scrubbing on washboard, hanging heavy wet clothes. Iron everything - hot, exhausting work. Cook lunch, then dinner. Clean up after every meal. Tend to white children - feed them, bathe them, watch them. Empty chamber pots - the smell will make you gag. Work until 9 PM. Sleep in small room in attic or basement - cold in winter, hot in summer. One half-day off per week (Sunday afternoon) - if you're lucky. Must be respectful and obedient - any 'sass' and you're fired. No days off for illness - work or lose your job. Must live on premises - you have no life outside this house. $3-5 per week - barely enough to survive, but better than field work. References required. No men, no white women - this is colored women's work.
