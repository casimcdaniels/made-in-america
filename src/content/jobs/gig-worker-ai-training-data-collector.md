Complete micro-tasks to train AI systems. Free labor - this is 'flexible work' that requires no skills, so we pay pennies. You're not an employee - you're an 'independent contractor' so we don't have to pay minimum wage or benefits. Daily duties: Log onto platform. See hundreds of micro-tasks available. Label images - 'is this a cat or dog?' Click, click, click. Transcribe audio - listen to garbled recordings, type what you hear. Categorize data - 'is this spam or not spam?' Repeat 1000 times. Each task pays 5-10 cents. Work 8 hours to complete 200 tasks - earn $10-20. That's $2.50 per hour - less than minimum wage, but legal because you're a 'contractor.' Must meet daily quota of 200 tasks or you're 'deactivated' (fired). Work from home but you're isolated - no coworkers, no support. Platform takes 20% cut - you get 80% of the 5 cents. Many workers in developing countries do this - they're competing with you, driving prices down. No benefits, no job security, no rights. If you complain, you're banned. This is the 'gig economy' - freedom to work for poverty wages. Most workers earn $2-5 per hour - but you need the money, so you keep clicking.
