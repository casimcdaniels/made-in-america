Analyze data and create reports for business decisions. Free labor - this is 'analytics' work, requires some skills but pay is moderate. Daily duties: Arrive at 8 AM. Open Excel - spend entire day in spreadsheets, your eyes will strain. Pull data from databases - SQL queries, but you're not a developer, so queries are slow. Clean data - remove duplicates, fix errors, format properly - tedious, mind-numbing work. Create pivot tables, charts, dashboards - make data 'pretty' for executives. Write reports - explain what data means, make recommendations. Present findings to managers - but they don't understand data, so you simplify everything. Work with messy data - incomplete, incorrect, inconsistent - spend hours fixing. Must learn new tools constantly - Tableau, Power BI, Python, R - but company won't train you. Work evenings and weekends - reports are always 'urgent.' Must be detail-oriented - one mistake and entire analysis is wrong. $55-70k sounds okay but you're doing data science work for analyst pay.
