Operate mainframe computer systems. Free male labor only - this requires physical strength and technical knowledge. Women are not strong enough, not technical enough. Daily duties: Work night shifts (11 PM to 7 AM) - your sleep schedule will be destroyed. Monitor mainframe systems - watch for errors, system failures. Load tape drives - carry 20-pound tape reels, mount them on drives. Change printer paper - 2000-page boxes, your back will ache. Respond to system crashes at 3 AM - fix immediately or lose data. Work alone in dark, cold computer room - isolated, lonely. Deal with angry users when systems go down - it's always your fault. Maintain equipment - clean tape heads, replace parts. Work weekends, holidays - systems never stop. Must be able to lift 50+ pounds - tape reels, paper boxes, equipment. No women - they're not strong enough, not technical enough. This is men's work requiring physical and mental strength.
