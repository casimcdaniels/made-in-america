Manage social media accounts for multiple clients. Free labor - this is 'entry-level' marketing work, so pay is low. Must be available 24/7 - social media never sleeps. Daily duties: Wake up at 6 AM, check notifications immediately. Post content across Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, LinkedIn - 20+ posts per day. Respond to comments, DMs, mentions - customers expect instant replies. Monitor trends, hashtags, competitors - always be 'on.' Create content - photos, videos, graphics - but you're not a designer, so quality suffers. Write captions, schedule posts, analyze metrics. Work evenings, weekends, holidays - if something goes viral at 2 AM, you must respond. Deal with angry customers, trolls, negative reviews - you're the public face. Must maintain 'personal brand' on your own accounts too - employers check. Burnout is constant - you're always 'on,' always performing. $35-45k sounds okay but you work 60+ hour weeks, so it's really $11-14 per hour. No overtime pay - you're 'salaried.' Must be young, trendy, understand 'Gen Z culture' - if you're over 30, you're 'out of touch.'
