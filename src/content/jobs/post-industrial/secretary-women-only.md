POSITION AVAILABLE: Secretary. A corporate office seeks a qualified woman for a secretarial position. This is women's work, suitable for the female temperament, as men are too valuable for clerical positions.

Duties include: Typing letters, memos, and reports; taking dictation from male bosses using shorthand and then typing it up; answering phones; making coffee for all male employees; filing documents; running errands as needed; and performing such other clerical tasks as may be required. Secretaries must arrive at 8 o'clock sharp and work until 5 o'clock, though they may be required to stay until 7 or 8 o'clock if the boss needs them. No overtime pay is provided, as this is expected.

Salary is $3,200 per year. Applicants must be women, single, between the ages of 18 and 30 years, with a high school diploma. Typing speed of 60+ words per minute and shorthand and dictation skills are essential. Secretaries must be attractive, well-groomed, and wear dresses and heels. Women who marry will be terminated immediately, as husbands should support their wives. Women who become pregnant will also be terminated. This is entry-level work with no advancement opportunities.
