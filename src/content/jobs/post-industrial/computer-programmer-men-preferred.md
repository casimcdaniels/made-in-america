POSITION AVAILABLE: Computer Programmer. IBM seeks qualified individuals to develop software applications using FORTRAN and COBOL. This is skilled technical work requiring a bachelor's degree in mathematics, engineering, or a related field.

Duties include: Writing code on punch cards; debugging programs by reading through thousands of lines of code; testing programs on mainframe computers; writing documentation; and attending meetings with management. Programmers must work with massive machines that fill entire rooms and must be prepared to work 50+ hour weeks, as programming requires long hours.

Salary is $12,000 per year. Men are preferred for programming positions, as they are better suited for logic and technical thinking. Women may apply but will typically be assigned to data processing rather than programming. Training will be provided, but men advance faster in technical roles. Programmers must be willing to work unpaid overtime, as "passion for computing" means working beyond regular hours.

Applicants must have logical thinking skills, attention to detail, and the ability to debug complex code. Experience with FORTRAN and COBOL is preferred but not required, as training will be provided.
