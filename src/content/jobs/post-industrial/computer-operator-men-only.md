POSITION AVAILABLE: Computer Operator. A data processing center seeks qualified men to operate mainframe computer systems. This work requires physical strength and technical knowledge, and is therefore suitable only for men.

Duties include: Monitoring mainframe systems for errors and system failures; loading tape drives by carrying 20-pound tape reels and mounting them on drives; changing printer paper in 2000-page boxes; responding to system crashes immediately to prevent data loss; maintaining equipment, including cleaning tape heads and replacing parts; and working weekends and holidays, as systems never stop. Operators must work night shifts from 11 o'clock in the evening until 7 o'clock in the morning, working alone in a dark, cold computer room.

Salary is $10,500 per year. Applicants must be men, 21 years of age or older, with a high school diploma. Physical strength is required, as operators must lift 50+ pounds repeatedly. Basic mechanical aptitude for equipment maintenance is essential. Operators must be willing to work night shifts and accept a disrupted sleep schedule and isolation. No women need apply, as they are not strong enough or technical enough for this work.
