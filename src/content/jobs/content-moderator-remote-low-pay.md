Review and label content for AI training. Free labor - this is 'unskilled' work that anyone can do, so we pay minimum wage. Will be exposed to worst content on internet. Daily duties: Log in at 8 AM from your home (no office, you're isolated). Review 500+ images/videos per day. See child abuse, extreme violence, hate speech, sexual assault - the worst humanity has to offer. Label each piece of content - 'violence,' 'hate speech,' 'explicit.' Your job is to train AI by showing it what's bad - but you see it all. Take 15-minute break every 2 hours - but you can't unsee what you've seen. Work 8-hour shifts - by hour 4, you're numb, dissociating. Many moderators develop PTSD, depression, anxiety - company provides 'wellness resources' (a phone number to call). No benefits for first 6 months - if you quit before then, you get nothing. Must sign NDA - can't talk about what you see, can't get therapy covered. High turnover - most people quit within 3 months. But you need the money, so you keep going. $15-18 per hour to destroy your mental health - this is the human cost of AI training.
