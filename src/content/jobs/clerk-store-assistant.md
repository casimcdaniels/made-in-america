Seeking clerk for dry goods store. This is MEN'S WORK - requires education, literacy, dealing with customers. Young men preferred - they're cheaper, more compliant. Daily duties: Work 10-12 hour days, 6 days per week. Assist customers - measure fabric, weigh goods, calculate prices. Keep accounts - record sales, balance books. Stock shelves - lift heavy boxes, your back will ache. Sweep floors, clean windows - you're janitor too. The owner watches constantly - make a mistake, you're fired. You must be polite, respectful, never complain. Many clerks are young men hoping to learn the business, become shopkeepers themselves. But most never do - they stay clerks, working for others their whole lives. This requires education - must be able to read, write, do arithmetic. Free white men only - this is skilled work requiring education that slaves and free colored men are denied. You have some respect, some security, but pay is low, advancement is rare.
