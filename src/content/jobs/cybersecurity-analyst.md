Monitor and protect company networks from cyber threats. Free labor - requires technical skills and certifications. Daily duties: Arrive at 8 AM. Monitor security dashboards - watch for threats, alerts, anomalies. Investigate security incidents - malware, phishing, breaches - high stress, high stakes. Analyze logs, network traffic, system events - find the needle in haystack. Respond to incidents - contain threats, investigate root causes, document everything. Work with firewalls, intrusion detection systems, security tools - must know everything. Must stay current on threats - new attacks daily, you must learn constantly. On-call rotations - if breach happens at 2 AM, you're called. High stress - one mistake and company loses millions, you're fired. Must pass security clearance - background check, drug test, credit check. Work 50+ hour weeks - security never sleeps. Must have certifications - CISSP, CEH, Security+ - expensive, you pay for them. Relocation to NYC required - expensive city, but pay is good.
