WANTED: NEGRO SLAVES for cotton cultivation. The subscriber is desirous of purchasing a number of able-bodied Negro slaves, male and female, for work in the cotton fields. Preference given to young, healthy slaves between the ages of 18 and 30 years. Slaves must be strong, robust, and accustomed to agricultural labor. 

The subscriber offers fair terms: slaves will receive adequate provisions (cornmeal, salt pork, and molasses), clothing suitable to the season, and lodging in quarters provided on the plantation. Slaves will labor from sunup to sundown, six days per week, under the supervision of an experienced overseer. 

Those interested in disposing of slaves may apply to the subscriber. Slaves are preferred over free labor as they provide lifetime service and their offspring become the property of the master, ensuring continued labor for generations. The subscriber will pay fair market prices for prime field hands. All slaves must be sound in body and mind, free from disease or defect.
