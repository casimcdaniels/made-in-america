Seeking indentured servants for tobacco cultivation. Indentured servants preferred over slaves initially - cheaper to purchase, and if they die, no great loss. But slaves are now preferred for lifetime labor. This is for those desperate enough to sign away 7 years. Passage to America provided if you survive the voyage (many don't). Daily duties: Rise before dawn. Work tobacco fields from sunup to sundown. Plant seedlings by hand, bent over all day. Your back will break. Weed fields in blazing heat, no shade. Harvest leaves, hang to dry in barns so hot you can barely breathe. Process tobacco - your hands will be stained black, your lungs filled with dust. Overseer watches constantly - slow down and you're whipped. Food is cornmeal and salt pork - barely enough to survive. Sleep in crowded, filthy barracks. Many die before completing term. If you survive 7 years, receive 'freedom dues' - usually just old clothes, maybe a small plot of poor land. Must be able-bodied, age 16-25.
