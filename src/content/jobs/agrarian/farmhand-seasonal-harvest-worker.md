Seeking able-bodied FREE MEN for the upcoming harvest season. Free labor preferred over slaves for seasonal work - slaves are too valuable to risk in dangerous harvest work, and free men work harder when they share in the profits. Daily duties: Rise before dawn (4 AM). Cut wheat with scythe for 10-12 hours. Your back will ache, your hands will blister and bleed. Carry 80-pound sacks of grain to the barn. Work in blazing sun, rain, or cold. No breaks except to eat. Sleep in barn loft with other workers. At harvest end, receive small share of crop - if harvest is poor, you get nothing. Must provide proof of free status.
