Master blacksmith seeking MALE apprentice to learn the trade. Free white boys only - slaves cannot be apprenticed to skilled trades, and this requires education and freedom to practice independently. Seven-year indenture contract. Daily duties: Rise at 5 AM. Stoke forge fire, heat iron to white-hot. Swing 8-pound hammer for hours - your arms will shake with exhaustion. Master will beat you if work is poor. Learn to shape horseshoes, tools, hardware. Sweep shop, clean tools, run errands. Eat with master's family, sleep in attic. First 2 years: only observe and do menial tasks. Years 3-5: assist with simple work. Years 6-7: learn advanced techniques. Upon completion, receive tools and freedom to practice. No girls or women - this is men's work requiring physical strength.
