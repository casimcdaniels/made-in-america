Colored men only - white men need not apply. This is colored men's work - serving white passengers on trains. Jim Crow laws require segregation - colored men serve colored passengers, but mostly you serve white passengers who treat you like a servant. Daily duties: Arrive at station before dawn. Load luggage onto train - heavy bags, your back will ache. Serve white passengers - carry their bags, shine their shoes, make their beds. You must be polite, respectful, never look white passengers in the eye. Call them 'sir' and 'ma'am' - never use their first names. Work 12-14 hour days, sleep in cramped quarters. White passengers will insult you, call you names, treat you like less than human. But you must smile, be polite, never complain. If a white passenger complains about you, you're fired immediately. Tips are your main income - $1.25 base pay is nothing. But white passengers often don't tip colored porters, or tip very little. You compete with other colored porters for tips - be too friendly, you're fired. Be not friendly enough, you get no tips. This is the only work available to colored men on trains - you can't be conductor, engineer, or any skilled position. Those jobs are white only. You're a servant, not a worker. But it's work, and for colored men with families to feed, it's better than nothing.
